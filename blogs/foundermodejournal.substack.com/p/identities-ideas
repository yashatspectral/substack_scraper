Yo :) it’s Yash and Andrea! 
Welcome to the the founder/mode journal! 
In each issue, we break down successful Linkedin posts so you can reverse engineer them for your own content. 
This week, we’re tackling a post from one of best storytellers we know, Adam Delehanty. 
Adam is the founder of Ghost, a ghostwriting and content agency that has worked with companies like Hinge and Duolingo. 
There’s a lot to learn from his approach to storytelling. 
Let’s get into it. 
Here is the post we’re unpacking today: 
Adam Delehanty’s post works because it perfectly articulates a psychological tension many founders and creators quietly feel, esp with all the noise surrounding AI currently. This post resonated because it frames identity in uncertain times. 
The post assigns clear identities: 
Automators and Artisans. 
By explicitly naming these two archetypes, Adam immediately triggers our inherent desire for social categorization. Humans naturally categorize themselves to simplify decision-making and build identity. Adam's labels immediately prompt readers to ask themselves: Am I an Automator, or an Artisan? And what does that say about me? 
This is a classic. Adam effectively uses structured contrasts: 
“Automators optimize for speed and volume. Artisans go slow and work inside-out.” 
“Automators measure everything. Artisans trust their vision.” 
Psychologically, contrasts help simplify complexity, enabling readers to quickly understand distinctions and align themselves. This approach naturally invites curiosity and introspection, as readers instinctively evaluate where they stand on each spectrum. 
Adam highlights universally admired qualities (for both categories!) 
“The best automators are thoughtful, curious, and hopeful. The best artisans are thoughtful, curious, and hopeful.” 
Because these traits appeal to readers' aspirational identities, it subtly encourages readers to align themselves positively with Adam’s viewpoint irrespective of where they stand on the AI optimist ←> AI doomer spectrum. 
The opening—"The people I respect most seem to be splitting into two camps"—is really good and functional but could be turned up a notch. A more emotionally charged opening, such as "A quiet division is emerging among creators I deeply admire," could have worked better. 
Adam mentions the "overlap" as where the real magic happens — a brief example could have grounded this idea / made a more compelling case. 
→ Identity > Ideas. Defining clear archetypes helps readers instantly self-identify and engage.→ Embrace nuance. This ain’t 2010, and you don’t need to surrender to the algo. Recognizing complexity / nuance is a big credibility boost and Adam does this super well. → Leverage aspirational identities. Highlight admired traits to inspire deeper connection and positive alignment. 
Alrighty, that’s all from us!
