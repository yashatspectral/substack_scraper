Hey, it’s Yash and Andrea - in this issue, we’re unpacking content from Alyona Mysko. 
Alyona is the co-founder and CEO of fuelfinance - a platform that helps founders and execs manage their financial ops. As B2B as it gets. 
She’s grown to ~30k LinkedIn followers, and her posts consistently convert because they deliver three things B2B decision-makers love: competence, clarity, and control. 
In this issue, we unpack the psychology powering Alyona’s content, and extract insights that B2B founders can apply to their own content. 
Let’s get into it. 

First, prove you can do the job. Next, prove you’re human. 
Alyona signals competence by using industry-lingo interspersed with fuel’s value props. 
Once credibility is secured, she layers in warmth via personal anecdotes: pictures of her dog, her experience living sober, etc. 
The mix works because readers see a safe pair of hands first, then a human behind them. 
Her posts often follow a repeatable arc: confess a costly mistake, reveal the system that fixed it, and leave behind a portable rule. 
Confession builds trust. The system restores order. The rule gives readers a compact decision script. It’s vulnerability that resolves into control. Highly persuasive in a domain defined by risk. 
The stereotypical Linkedin format gets a lot of flack but it’s popular for a reason. It works because it’s cognitively easy to absorb. Alyona uses it to make finance legible. 
Numbers anchor abstractions (“$1.2M shortfall,” “<12-month payback”). 
Task verbs create action steps. 
Metaphors reduce complexity (“Accounting = eyesight, FP&A = steering”). 
Her posts make readers feel like they have something to see and act on, not just skim. 
In finance, restraint builds credibility. Alyona cuts through noise by countering hype: 
“Anyone selling you ‘fully autonomous finance’ right now is selling fiction.” 
By sketching out a phased roadmap instead of hyperbole, she earns trust amongst risk-averse finance buyers who value judgment over optimism. 
. 
Reminds me of what Morgan Housel wrote here: 
Pessimism always sounds smarter than optimism because optimism sounds like a sales pitch while pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you. 

Alyona’s posts reduce ambiguity. They make readers feel high agency in a world of buzz words and hype. 
That’s why her content lands. 
Until next time, 
Yash & Andrea
