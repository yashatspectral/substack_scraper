Hey, it’s Yash and Andrea. 
You’re receiving this because you’re a founder/mode user, or part of our broader community. 
We’re super psyched to announce the beta launch of founder/mode v2! 
founder/mode is designed to help busy founders put their Linkedin and X content on autopilot. Convert your raw thoughts into engaging social content that actually moves the needle for your startup. 
As promised, subscribers on this list get their first month on us! Sign up with the code FMV2 to claim your first month for free. 
Getting started is super easy: 
Connect your X and Linkedin account and adjust your content style. 
Download our chrome extension and add founder/mode to your Slack workspace. This makes sharing content ideas with us WAY easier. 
Start sharing content ideas! These can be your reading highlights, bits from your company blog, voice notes, and everything in between. We highly recommend voice notes btw ;) 
That’s it! Here’s a short video explaining how founder/mode works: 
Have feedback for us? Just respond to this email! We’re super early and are looking to build this thing with our early users. Your random observation or offhand remark could end up shaping what the ultimate product looks like. 
You can also schedule some time here. 
Cheers, 
Yash & Andrea
